#fizzbuzz, for every multiple of 3 = 'fizz', multiple of 5 = 'buzz'
#a very simple challenge

for i in range(1,101):
    if i%3 == 0:
         print('fizz')
    elif i%5 == 0:
        print('buzz')
    else:
         print(i)

#take a step further where i='fizzbuzz' if integer divisible by both 3 and 5
